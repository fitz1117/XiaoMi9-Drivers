## Corresponding versions of UEFI and Drivers
> [!NOTE]
> - Please ensure that the versions of UEFI and the drivers you are using correspond to each other to avoid unexpected problems.
> - UEFI Versions: Here, we use "Release Versions" to refer to each of the currently officially released UEFI Versions.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - The drivers on the main branch are usually only compatible with the UEFI (& ACPI) of the main branch. Since there are some important driver changes that need to be used in conjunction with ACPI & UEFI, we do not recommend using the drivers on the main branch with a UEFI release that is too outdated.
